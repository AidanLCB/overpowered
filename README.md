This mod adds powerful endgame tools, armor, and blocks for players that feel like they have everything in the game, this is yet another milestone for you to reach. While these items are made very powerful they are also very hard to get as you need 1 diamond block and 1 Mese block for each ingot as well as some of these items that need not only OP Ingots but OP Blocks meaning you will need 9 more.

### Crafting Guide ###

**OP Alloy Ingots**: Place 2 Diamond Blocks and 2 Mese Blocks in the craft grid in a 2x2 checkered pattern to get 2 Untreated OP Ingots. Smelt these in a furnace for 10 minutes to then get the OP Alloy Ingots. It is recommended to use Coal Blocks as fuel.

**OP Alloy Blocks**: Fill the 3x3 craft grid with OP Alloy Ingots in the same way that you would craft blocks made from other ores.

**Tools/Weapons**: To craft the sword use 2 OP Alloy Ingots and 1 Obsidian Shard in the same pattern as a default sword. For the OP Mining Multitool use 2 Obsidian Shards for the handle and 3 OP Alloy Blocks in the shape of a pickaxe.

**Armor**: The OP Leggings and Boots are the same as the default layout with ingots, however in the OP Helmet there is an OP Alloy Block in the middle on the top row. The Chestplate has a OP Alloy Block in the very center.

**Food**: Place 1 OP Ingot on either side of a normal apple to create 10 OP Apples, each restoring 20 HP (10 hearts) by default.

**Material Cost Breakdown**:

    OP Alloy Ingot = 9 Diamonds + 9 Mese Crystals
    OP Alloy Block = 81 Diamonds + 81 Mese Crystals
    OP Sword = 18 Diamonds, 18 Mese Crystals, 1 Obsidian Shard
    OP Mining Multitool = 243 Diamonds, 243 Mese Crystals, 2 Obsidian Shards
    OP Leggings = 63 Diamonds + 63 Mese Crystals
    OP Boots = 36 Diamonds + 36 Mese Crystals
    OP Helmet = 117 Diamonds + 117 Mese Crystals
    OP Chestplate = 144 Diamonds + 144 Mese Crystals
    OP Apple = 1.8 Diamonds, 1.8 Mese Crystals, 1 Apple
