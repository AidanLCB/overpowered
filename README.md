 If there's anything that the Minetest modding community seems to love,
it's explosives.  More explosions, more destruction, better efficiency
and better performance.

This mod is the culmination of all explosive mods.  It adds a nuclear
device to the game that's powerful enough to destroy the entire world,
and kill all players instantly.  Intense radiation renders the world
completely and permanently uninhabitable.  Terrain destruction is done
extremely efficiently via the Anthropic Principle.

### Crafting:

**Ingots**: Use 2 diamond blocks and 2 mese in the craft grid in a checkered pattern to get 2 untreated ingots. Smelt these in a furnace to then get the ingots.

**Blocks**: Fill craft grid with ingots in the same way that you would craft blocks made from other ores.

**Tools/Weapons**: To craft the sword use 2 ingots and 1 obsidian shard in the same pattern as a default sword. For the multitool use 2 obsidian shards and 3 alloy blocks in the shape of a pickaxe.

**Armor**: Same as default with ingots, however in the helmet there is a block in the top row and and in the chestplate a block in the very center.
